> Help me run a quick examination. Follow these steps exactly:

  1. Glob for all files mentioning "ui" in the path,
  2. Grep for the specific file that defines `pub const TEXT_INPUT_HEIGHT`,
  3. Read the contents of that file,
  4. Edit the file to add a comment at the top with the list of public functions,
  5. Run the command `cargo check` to confirm the project still compiles

● I'll help you examine the codebase and make the requested changes. Let me start by creating a todo list and then
  following your steps exactly.
